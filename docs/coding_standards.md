# 1 Introduction

This document serves as the complete definition of coding standards for source code in the MarconiTT application. A JavaScript or Python source file is described as being in MarconiTT Style if and only if it adheres to the rules herein.  

Like other programming style guides, the issues covered span not only aesthetic issues of formatting, but other types of conventions or coding standards as well. However, this document focuses primarily on the hard-and-fast rules that we follow universally, and avoids giving advice that isn't clearly enforceable (whether by human or tool).

# 2 Python source files

Following PEP8 documentation is recommended to write good python code. It can be found here: https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0008/ 

# 3 JavaScript source files 

Javascript files in this project don't follow a specific coding standard. The good recommendation is to follow the ethical rules of clean programming. A good code can be understood even without comments nor extreme documentation.
